 * ==================

 * rxCLFLAGS_EXTERNAL data usually lives outside the pipeline execution heap;
 * it may have been allocated with RwMalloc(), as a ResEntry, with a DMA
 * buffer allocator, may live in ROM, who knows...
 *
 * The crucial point is that powerpipe is not empowered to free/resize/modify
 * this block - a cluster passively references the block; the onus is on the
 * block's owner to clean-up as necessary after pipeline execution
 *
 * Attempts to lockwrite() external clusters will cause the cluster data
 * to be copied into the pipeline execution heap, and this (now
 * non-rxCLFLAGS_EXTERNAL) copy will be propagated with the cluster.
 *
 * rxCLFLAGS_EXTERNAL is sometimes used for memory which is in the pipe
 * execution heap so as to convey that a cluster merely references (vs. owns)
 * the memory, and that the memory shouldn't die with that cluster

 *
 * the "next" pointers provide a means of iterating across root-level
 * scope traces (a scope trace ceases to be root-level if it is subsumed
 * by another scope trace during merging)
 *
 * scope tracing for a given cluster "cl" proceeds effectively as
 * follows:
 *
 * (o) create a new root-level scope trace for cluster cl
 *
 * (o) starting at node x [where cluster cl originates], add to the scope
 * trace the RwReqEntry wherein node x references cluster cl
 *
 * (o) traverse the pipeline graph commencing at node x down through
 * those outputs of node x *through which cluster cl flows*, and the
 * outputs' outputs, etc.
 *
 * (o) while traversing, add all RwReqEntrys referencing cluster cl to
 *     the scope trace under construction
 *
 * (o) we've now traced the scope of cluster cl
 *
 * (o) there is a complication, however: pipeline graphs, as well as
 *     branching, can recombine
 *
 * (o) recombination means that following cluster cl down from node y
 *     (perhaps a sibling of node x, which also creates cluster cl), we may
 *     ultimately reach a node where the ReqEntry for cluster cl has already
 *     been assigned to the scope trace which tracked cluster cl down from
 *     node x (i.e. the scope traces overlap)
 *
 * (o) in that case, the two scope traces (which we had in effect
 *     previously assumed corresponded to independent existences of cluster
 *     cl) are merged into one
